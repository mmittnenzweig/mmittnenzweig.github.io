### Welcome!

<img style="width:7em" src="images/foto_owf.jpg" align="right">
I am a postdoc in the group of [Amos Tanay](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/tanay/) at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Previously, I was a PhD student at the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin.  

My current research focuses on understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms during mammalian gastrulation.
